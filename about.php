                                            Africa Interfaith Uganda was formed after careful study of our continent Africa, our region East
											Africa and our country Uganda. We have labored to look deep into several aspects of life
											including; political, spiritual, cultural, religious and social life. We have realized that the problems
											affecting us are the same and any efforts to solve them will help the whole continent.
											We have realized that all kingdoms in Africa share the same problems and limitations, which
											means solving these problems and limitations in one country will influence the whole continent.
											The influence of kingdoms in the leadership of these African nations cannot be ignored but must
											be embraced, perfected and empowered to positively contribute to the leadership of our
											countries especially our country Uganda.
											The religious leaders have chosen war instead of peace, a few who have chosen peace do not
											discuss issues affecting their doctrine, and this situation affects the believers and followers
											because they expect the truth from their leaders which is not availed. The most asked question
											is why should we all be talking about the same God and the same Jesus but fight each other and
											have different denominations that don’t agree? Surely someone there is wrong or something is
											wrong! We intend to come to the root cause of all these differences with God’s help.
											The most important productive, religious, social, spiritual, political institution formed and
											instituted by God, this institution is called family. The father, mother and the children, the
											relatives and friends form the family, and this crucial institution is currently under full attack and
											needs urgent intervention by servants and people who speak on behalf of God. The people
											currently regulating this institution have no idea of God’s intention when creating this institution
											and there for are incompetent to handle this glorious institution, leading it into equality and
											divorces everywhere. Men of God need to come together and reason with God as called for in
											the bible; Isaiah 1:18 18 “Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins
											are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like
											wool. You are all welcome with your different reasons to the reasoning table of God.

                                         <h4>ADVANTAGES OF INTERFAITH DIALOGUE</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">There are a number of valuable benefits. If we agree that dialogue is a religious requirement, then
									dialogue contributes to the fulfillment of our religion. If we agree that dialogue is a natural expression of
									our innate human disposition, then dialogue enriches our experience as human beings.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The merits of Dialogue between followers of different faith traditions can be listed as follows:
									Interfaith dialogue demonstrates to the public how different faiths can live together in harmony without
									hurting or insulting each other’s instincts. The attitude of dialogue should not be aggressive, it teaches
									the viewers and its followers that every religion and its followers must be given due respect. It significantly
									improves a person’s understanding of the other person. While the person can learn a significant amount
									about another religion from books, talking to people who practice that religion about what they believe,
									what they do and how they feel about it transforms a person’s knowledge and more importantly his/her
									understanding. It enhances understanding, goodwill and a sense of community between people of
									different faiths.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Inter-faith dialogue is helpful in removing the fear from the minds of the minorities who are oppressed
									and help them to co-operate with the majority community in the field of development and prosperity of
									the nation.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Interfaith dialogue helps to explore and learn about each other and know more about the traditions of
									one’s faith. Every person’s inner soul is in search for a deep understanding of the truth that includes
									Almighty God, the Universe and the Life. The process of dialogue helps the participants and the viewers
									to get an insight of the concepts of truth in other religions, which will help them to get a clear vision of
									the different aspects of facts and truth. Also the knowledge and insight of other religions will help to
									eradicate the misconceptions and misunderstandings of any particular religion.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Dialogue between followers of different faith traditions helps each religion to grow and develop mutually.
									Each religion through dialogue helps other religion for its enrichment. Interfaith dialogue provides space
									for the religions to contribute and complement each other. It helps society as a whole by producing better
									mutual understanding among the believers of different religions</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Dialogue between followers of different faith traditions encourages in supporting of each other in times
									of difficulty. When natural or man-made calamities strike upon the society, dialogue helps in creating
									people and individuals who do relief work irrespective of caste, creed, religion, language etc. They don’t
									consider priorities in rendering their much-needed services. They only see that their services are rendered
									in its proper channel to each and every one affected by the calamities. (The best example is during this
									pandemic COVID -19 in all parts of the world, people help each other irrespective of their religions.) As
									Uganda recovers from the effects of a nationwide lockdown since; March 2020. Many people were stuck
									at home alone, leaving the elderly especially feeling lonely and cut-off from family and friends. But While
									both the governments is actively working on implementing new measures to battle COVID-19, and fixing
									logistical glitches in existing lockdown procedures, it is the ordinary citizens and their extraordinary acts
									of kindness that have proven to be a bright spot in this dark and desolate time. Along with all the fear and
									panic caused by the coronavirus, the pandemic has also seen kindness go viral across the globe, with
									neighbors and complete strangers pitching in to help. People have been provided meals across the country
									during the lockdown, a good number of people were fed by the Government, Individuals, Religious and
									Faith based non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and all this was done without knowing or asking each
									other’s religion.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Doctors in Uganda, like elsewhere, are on the front lines fighting the pandemic, and they are often working
									around the clock. Their anxiety and stress levels at work are immense, but through this tough journey,
									they have helped lots of people irrespective of their religions.</p> 
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Likewise, when any individual of any particular religion suffer economically or physically he will be looked
									after and taken care of by the members of the other religious groups without considering his religion. This
									mind can be set up and build very strongly with the help of interfaith dialogues. There are many moral
									stories, which expose the moral values or are brought as examples for a particular moral value in every
									religion. These stories of morality and virtue can be exchanged in the process of interfaith dialogue, which
									will be quite helpful to the recipients in inducing those values among its followers.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Interfaith dialogue helps the people with whom you are talking to understand any religion. The experience
									of dealing with anyone is limited to situations such as the workplace where you never talk in any depth
									about your religion, what you practice and how you feel about it. By taking part in interfaith dialogue, you
									can help each other to understand that the people who follow other religions are intelligent, sympathetic
									who can discuss their differences with members of other religions while remaining completely confident
									in their own.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Dialogue between followers of different faith traditions is of great help to achieve common goals of the
									society and nation. It enhances the participation of every member of every religion in the development
									and prosperity of the nation.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Dialogues help in making public opinion against the evils prevailing in the society and thus result in its
									eradication from the society. Dialogues minimize the gap between communities, which in turn reinforces
									the national integration and unity. “All human beings are entitled to participate in the activities that will
									shape the world in the third millennium. No nation should be left on the sidelines because of some
									doctrinal, philosophical, political or economic argument. It is not enough to tolerate others but one must
									work with others. The human world must be shaped by the massive cooperation of all human beings.
									Though this notion up to the early 20th century sounded like a humanist motto, today it is a necessity for
									the continuation of human life.”</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">All religions believe in selfless service to humanity. With the help of interfaith dialogue, the services and
									aids can be extended to the people of other religions also. Muslim have a remarkable historical
									background of good communal bonds with other communities. Islam itself encourages and teaches its
									followers to maintain communal harmony with members of other religions, while Christians also teach
									members to love their neighbors as they love themselves. During the festive seasons religious
									organizations can give more attention to such activities. During the month of Ramadan in and Christmas
									there are many organizations and political parties, which extend their aids and distribute relief funds
									among the needy regardless of their religion.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">If there are some joint activities in this regard it will bring good results and thrust for peaceful co-existence.
									This group of religious leadership can run schools and hospitals and other institutions and funding
									agencies jointly in areas where people of different religious denomination resides and create an
									atmosphere where people of different religions can interact peacefully.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The paradoxical benefit of engaging in interfaith dialogue is that it helps a person to understand his/her
									own religion much better. They may have been brought up practicing their religion but that is not the
									same as studying it in depth to find out how it addresses fundamental issues. When a person preparing
									for any formal interfaith dialogue discussions, they have to do a significant amount of research on the
									scripts of their own religion as it is essential to put forward propositions which are firmly grounded in the 
									texts rather than being at risk of simply conveying the own assumptions about what the person think of
									his/her religion.</p>

									<h4>FAMILY HILLOCKY</h4>
									<h4>The Father</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The position of the father is undisputed as the head of the home, the spirit of God the Father sits in him
									and uses him to govern the Home in a Godly way. The first church of God is a home, the first dwelling
									place of God is the home and that is why the devil fights it very much because it knows that when it loses
									the battle in homes it will have lost the war. The home must be well established because it is the
									foundation of the body of Christ.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">If any man wishes to serve God as a bishop but can’t manage his own home, he will not be allowed to
									manage God’s home? 1Timothy 3:1-5 “Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an
									overseer, he desires a noble task. Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one
									wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not
									violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see
									that his children obey him with proper respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family,
									how can he take care of God’s church?)”</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">God is the head of Christ and Christ is the head of a man and a man is the head of a woman, the hillocky
									of heaven is the same hillocky in the home. 1Corrinthians 11:3 “Now I want you to realize that the head
									of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.”</P>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The father produces the body or the fresh but we also have the heavenly father who produces the soul
									and spirit. The family members depend on the provision by the two fathers, the physical father and the
									spiritual father, during sex at the time of producing a man and a woman will transform into spiritual
									experience so that the child to be conceived has both the body soul and spirit. Luke 11:2 “He said to them,
									“When you pray, say: “‘our father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.</p>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Matthew 6:17-18 “But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be
									obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees
									what is done in secret, will reward you.”</p>
									<h4>The Mother</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The mother is another important personality in the home and the Holy Spirit sits in her to help her perform
									her duty in the setup of the home.</p>
									<h4>The First Born Male</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The firstborn male another important personality in a home his title in a hoe is hair, the spirit of Christ sits>
									in him to help him carry on his fathers will and linage.</p>
									<h4>The Children</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The boys and girls born in the same family, these include children born to the father and those produced
									by the mother. Clarity has to be made here, so as to avoid confusion in the home.</p>
									<h4>Extended Family</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">These include the relatives on the side of the father and mother, the uncles, unties, in-laws, and the rest
									of the relatives from their families.</p>
									<h4>Friends</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">All the family friends that usually come into the home have limitations in circles of the family, members
									must know how to treat each one of them.</p>
									<h4>Visitors / Strangers</h4>
									<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The bible teaches that we should always entertain strangers for sometimes we entertain angels without
									knowing. Therefore strangers have a place in our homes, but we must know the boundaries of each of the
									mentioned family members.</p>
                                        <h4>FINAL REMAARKS</h4>
                                        <p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">To conclude I would say, the Dialogue between different leader’s followers of different faith traditions is
										not about conversion. It is the best practical expression of peace and harmony. It does not mean to accept
										one’s religion but it is essential to stand-in communal harmony as well as teaching you about the other
										religions, engaging in it helps you to understand your own religion better. To combat communal hatred
										and promote inter-community harmony, people of different faiths must strive to promote a culture of
										dialogue. People should work together to make the world better. They should be able to make the ways
										to come out of the dangers of the modern technocracy and environmental devastation, energy crises,
										youth problems, hunger, violent radicalism and decadence of morality and faith. In addition, every human
										being should have the ability to discuss their religious and cultural differences, which is very important in
										a democratic society such as ours that is filled with people whose differences are deep and complex in
										nature.</P>
										<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">Dialogue between followers of different faith traditions can be an excellent way to heal divisions in
										society. Social science research indicates that having a positive, meaningful relationship with someone of
										a different background and learning about his or her identity correlates to viewing that person’s entire
										group more favorably. The same logic applies with interfaith conversations. It is also experienced that the
										discussion and study about any other religion helps one to be more acquainted and have deep knowledge
										in his own religion. The good aspects of every religion should be taught in schools and seminaries and in
										upper level religious parliaments can be organized for the exchange of ideas and views about religion in
										the presence of religious scholars. Such exchanges will help form reasonable ideas of co- existence in
										students. Further the interfaith dialogue between Muslims, Christians, and other faith will help in
										removing partialities and misunderstandings about one another and help to realize common objectives
										such as the establishment of peace and justice in the world, the protection of families from disintegration,
										the fortification of human rights as given by God and the promotion of moral values. In this context of
										interfaith dialogue, there are three Categories of people to deal with;</p>
										<ul>
										<li style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">First are those who have the will and inclination to understand the fundamentals of other faith. This group
										tries to read, learn and understand about other religion through various means.</li>
										<li style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The second group of people is those who have an allergy towards other religion. They have fixed opinion
										about other religion and do not want to listen anything positive about any faith.</li>
										<li style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The third group of people have empty mind towards other faith. They fall prey to many misconceptions
										about other faiths.</li></ul>
										<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">The challenge before us working towards interfaith dialogue of religions in Uganda is to engage all the
										three categories of people and reach out to them with the message of humanity and peaceful coexistence.
										It is very important for our future generations. Our discourses today, would pattern the lives of our 
										children in future. Now it is in our hands to determine the future of our children, we have to decide now
										whether our children should live in harmony, peace and coexistence or leave them to live in discord and
										religious wars forever.</p>
										<p style="text-align:Center;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">May Allah / Almighty God Bless and gives you the courage to be part of those who advocate for interfaith
										peace, unity and coexistence dialogue in Uganda. <p>
